1. Take both storage and robots into consideration. 
Distance from the goal should be caculated based on the distance from each box to storage points and robots.

2. Checking for deadlocks. 
In some states some boxes are trapped and never able to reach a storage (for example, box trapped in a corner), these states should be avoided.

3. Improve code efficency. 
For many states the boxes are in the same locations, we can save the computed distance value and reuse it to reduce running time.
